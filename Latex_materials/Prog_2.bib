Neural networks are a powerful technology for classification of visual inputs arising from documents. However, there is a confusing plethora of different neural network methods that are used in the literature and in industry. This paper describes a set of concrete best practices that document analysis researchers can use to get good results with neural networks. The most important practice is getting a training set as large as possible: we expand the training set by adding a new form of distorted data. The next most important practice is that convolutional neural networks are better suited for visual document tasks than fully connected networks. We propose that a simple “do-it-yourself” implementation of convolution with a flexible architecture is suitable for many visual document problems. This simple convolutional neural network does not require complex methods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure dependent learning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop, or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is a very simple yet general architecture which can yield state-of-the-art performance for document analysis. We illustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digit images.

Both searches converge to the same events, which have the signature of a two-body decay of a particle of mass ∼80 GeV/c2. The topology as well as the number of events fits well the hypothesis that they are produced by the proces p̄+p→W±+X, with W± →e±+ν; where W± is the Intermediate Vector Boson postulated by the unified theory of weak and electromagnetic inter- actions."

These events fit well the hypothesis that they are produced by the process p̄ + p → Z0 + X (with Z0 → ℓ+ + ℓ−), where Z0 is the Intermediate Vector Boson postulated by the electroweak theories as the mediator of weak neutral currents."

	title = {The {CMS} experiment at the {CERN} {LHC}},
	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The
detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  It was
conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at
luminosities up to 1034 cm−2 s−1 (1027 cm−2 s−1).  At the core of the CMS detector sits a
high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid
surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate
scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a
brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter.  The iron yoke of the
flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors
covering most of the 4π solid angle.  Forward sampling
calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values
(|η| ⩽ 5) assuring very good hermeticity.  The overall
dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of
14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}

	abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion
detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction
sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of
strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values
of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides
running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with
lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs.
ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to
collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several
QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors.
The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently
over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. 
Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m3 with a total weight 
of approximately
10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each
with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven
both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected
at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme
particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The
different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum
resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad
range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC.
This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons,
and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei.
Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data 
taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, 
with the exception of
parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector
(TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be
completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010.

This paper describes in detail the detector components as
installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.}
